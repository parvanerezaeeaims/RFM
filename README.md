# RFM Analysis

## Introduction

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to quantify and evaluate a customer's value based on their purchasing behavior. The RFM model is based on three key factors:
- **Recency (R)**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency (F)**: How often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary (M)**: How much money a customer spends on purchases.

## RFM Segmentation

RFM analysis helps in segmenting customers into different categories based on their scores. This allows businesses to tailor their marketing efforts and improve customer retention.

### Key Segments

1. **Champions**: Recent, frequent, and high-value buyers.
2. **Loyal Customers**: Frequent buyers who are less recent but still high-value.
3. **Potential Loyalists**: Recent and high-value but less frequent.
4. **New Customers**: Recent but low-frequency and low-value buyers.
5. **Promising**: Recent and high-frequency but low-value buyers.
6. **Need Attention**: Recent and moderate frequency and value buyers.
7. **At Risk**: Former high-value customers who haven't purchased recently.
8. **Canâ€™t Lose Them**: High-value and high-frequency buyers who haven't purchased recently.
9. **Hibernating**: Low-frequency and low-value buyers who haven't purchased recently.
10. **Lost**: Low-value and low-frequency buyers who haven't purchased for a long time.

## Example Segment: **Former High Spenders**

### Characteristics
- **Low Frequency Scores**: These customers do not make purchases often.
- **Low Monetary Scores**: These customers do not spend much.
- **High Recency Values**: These customers have not interacted with the brand recently.

## Conclusion

RFM analysis is a powerful tool for understanding customer behavior and enhancing marketing strategies. By identifying and targeting specific segments, businesses can improve customer engagement and drive sales.
